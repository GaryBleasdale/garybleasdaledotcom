I've worked across many different domains and projects, rapidly achieving successful results - this is possible because I care about what I do (I like German word 'Sorge' to describe this feeling), and am laser-focussed on improving my skills and on learning as much as possible. \n I've been working as a Shopify developer for the past 3+ years, after spending 5 years in managerial roles in Programmatic advertising . During these three years, I've been lucky enough to work on, and lead, complex, high-impact projects, and learn from amazing colleagues in the eComm space.",
